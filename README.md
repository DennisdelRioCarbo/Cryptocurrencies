# Cryptocurrencies

In this project we'll be creating an analysis of the cryptocurrency market. We'll process data, cluster, reduce dimensions, and reduce the principal components using PCA, to use unsupervised machine learning. 

The universe of cryptocurrencies is vast, so we'll create a report that includes which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.

The data will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. Weâ€™ll use data visualizations to share our findings.
